# Monitoring Self Adaptive Systems

## Concept

The software will first detect potential variables in the AI program.
The software will then run multiple instances of the AI program and change the parameters at runtime and try to figure out when the program crashes. 


The project is in development phase so no GUI is available and no report is generated. Though the software core functionality is in place.

This is just a demo of the system.
The wrapper.py file is the main file.
The environment.py file is a flappy bird AI program written using NEAT module.

## To run the file.

Just run the wrapper.py file. Make sure all the requirements are pre-installed.
